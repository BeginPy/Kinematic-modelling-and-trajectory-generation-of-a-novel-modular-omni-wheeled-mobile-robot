In this project, we aim to build two types of novel omnidirectional mobile robot in coppeliasim and conduct trajectory generations with PID control.
Three trajectory cases are tested, and the result is satisfactory. 
The code is created with python directly in the coppeliasim software as scripts. 
Readers may find the codes by opening the coppeliasim software and see the scripts.
